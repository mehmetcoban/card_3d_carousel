}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Card 3D Carousel')),
      body: Card3DAnimation(
        totalCards: 78, // Total number of cards
        isCardSelected: isCardSelected,
        selectedCardImageUrl: selectedCardImageUrl,
        onCardSelected: () {
          setState(() {
            isCardSelected = true;
            selectedCardImageUrl = 'https://example.com/card-image.jpg';
          });
        },
        onAnimationCompleted: () {
          // Handle card selection completion

  }

```dart
Card3DAnimation(
  totalCards: 156,
  isAnimating: false, // Disable interactions during external animations
  isCardSelected: selectedCard != null,
  selectedCardImageUrl: selectedCard?.imageUrl,
  onCardSelected: () {
    // Handle card selection
    setState(() {
      selectedCard = getRandomCard();
    });
  },
  onAnimationCompleted: () {
    // Navigate to next screen or show card details
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => CardDetailsScreen(selectedCard!)),
    );
  },
)
